# Video Game Market Analysis

This is a project I started to get a better understanding of the amount of games and/or total sales, per recent system, for each genre. After exploring and cleaning this data, I will do some analysis and make use of Python modules to create bar charts which I will display in this repo.

## About the Data

The data set used in this project was created early January 2022 and downloaded from [data.world](https://data.world/sumitrock/video/), which scraped the data from [VGChartz](https://www.vgchartz.com/gamedb/).
> There is only 3 games from 2017 and 1 game from 2020, so I will be focusing on data from 2016 and earlier.

If you would like to learn more about how the data was scraped or try it yourself, you may be able to gain some insight by viewing [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/ashaheedq/vgchartzScrape). However, data scraping was outside of the scope of this project, so the data set from data.world was used for this analysis.
> The creator of this GitHub repo is unrelated to the creator of the dataset on data.world, but there are 61 forks linked to this GitHub repo. It is possible that the data set came from one of those forks.

VGChartz also has additional data on [total platform sales](https://www.vgchartz.com/analysis/platform_totals/). This was not included in the data set but is worth taking note of.

## MVP

* As a user, I should be able to select a genre and see which system had the largest number of games.
* As a user, I should be able to select a genre and see which system had the highest sales.

<!-- ## Additional Features -->

<!-- * Along with the title of show/movie, added an input field to the form for an optional comment.
* Changed pixel width/height to view width/height to look better on mobile.
* Made the title of this project a header that stays at the top of the browser while scrolling.
* Created a sidebar image for some extra flair. -->

<!-- ## Challenge
I wanted to be able to go from local testing to Heroku deployment without needing to modify the code every time I went from one to the other. My original solution I came up with after doing some research was to set the baseURL object in the client folder equal to window.location.origin instead of having the URL in my code. I later changed that to use window.location.origin to see if it includes Heroku, and depending on the truthiness of that function, use the production or development URL. -->
