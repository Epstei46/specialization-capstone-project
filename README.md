## Description

> Video Game Market Analysis is a project I started to get a better understanding of the amount of games and/or total sales, per recent system, for each genre. After cleaning this data, I will make use of Python modules to create bar charts which I will display in this repo. However, the most recent data I could find sourced VGChartz, and only up to 2016-2017.


## MVP

* As a user, I should be able to select a genre and see which system had the largest number of games.
* As a user, I should be able to select a genre and see which system had the highest sales.

## Additional Features

<!-- * Along with the title of show/movie, added an input field to the form for an optional comment.
* Changed pixel width/height to view width/height to look better on mobile.
* Made the title of this project a header that stays at the top of the browser while scrolling.
* Created a sidebar image for some extra flair. -->

<!-- ## Challenge
I wanted to be able to go from local testing to Heroku deployment without needing to modify the code every time I went from one to the other. My original solution I came up with after doing some research was to set the baseURL object in the client folder equal to window.location.origin instead of having the URL in my code. I later changed that to use window.location.origin to see if it includes Heroku, and depending on the truthiness of that function, use the production or development URL. -->
